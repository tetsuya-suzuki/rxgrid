# What is rxgrid

rxgrid is a client program for Xgrid which is an environment for distributed and parallel computing on the Mac OS X operating system.

rxgrid enables users to
* submit Xgrid jobs specified not in the standard XML-based batch files but in Ruby-based concise batch files.
* manage them not by job IDs but by their logical names.
* execute ART scripts with command line arguments.
